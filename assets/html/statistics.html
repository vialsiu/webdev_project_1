        3. U.S. News and World Report Sleep Quality Survey 2022
        </h2>

            [Graph 5 and Graph 8]<br>
            <br>
            Roughly one-third of Americans are not currently getting quality sleep, according to our analysis. Nearly 20% of people said they rarely or never wake up well rested and 16% of people say they only feel well rested a few times a month. Only 13% of people say they usually wake up every day feeling well-rested.            <br>
            <br>
            The lack of sleep leaves many Americans ready to trade other pleasures for a high-quality snooze. Over 38% of people said they would give up eating out for a month in exchange for perfect sleep. Nearly 28% of people would give up seeing friends for a month, and roughly 27% of Americans would give up TV and movies in order to find that perfect night's sleep.            <br>
            <br>
            Most Americans recognize that they have some bad habits that interfere with their sleep. Over 40% of people say they change their bedtimes too often, and 33% of people say they eat too much before going to sleep. There's evidence that eating or drinking within one hour of bedtime can increase your chances of waking up in the middle of the night.
            <br>
            Maintaining a regular night routine is an important part of sleeping well. More than 72% of Americans said they stick to a tried-and-true sleep regimen, with nearly 40% of Americans listening to music and 10% listening to audiobooks to wind down at bedtime            <br>
