    <h2>
    1. Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker
    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraphs">
        Neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker provides a revolutionary exploration of sleep, examining how it affects every aspect of our physical and mental well-being. Charting the most cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, and marshalling his decades of research and clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness sleep to improve learning, mood and energy levels, regulate hormones, prevent cancer, Alzheimer's and diabetes, slow the effects of aging, and increase longevity. He also provides actionable steps towards getting a better night's sleep every night.    </h3>

    <h2>
    2. I Can Make You Sleep by Paul McKenna
    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraphs">
        Following the huge success of his blockbuster weight-loss program, Paul McKenna has created a groundbreaking new book-and-CD set that will be welcomed by millions. It reveals the secrets of getting regular, deep, refreshing sleep—and banishing insomnia for good.<br><br>

        McKenna understands the frustration of not getting a good night’s rest, and his trademarked system—which consists of the book and CD working in harmony to reset your body's natural sleep mechanism—is the solution every insomniac has been waiting for. Whether you find it difficult to fall sleep, wake frequently during the night, or get up too early, his method both increases the amount of sleep you enjoy and, crucially, improves its quality. And, one of the best things about McKenna’s technique, which took him 20 years to develop, is that you needn’t "believe" in it: just follow his instructions, listen to the CD, and watch what happens.    </h3>

    <h2>
    3. The Sleep Book by Dr Guy Meadows
    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraphs">
        THE SLEEP BOOK is the sum of a doctorate degree in sleep and well over 12,000 hours spent working with more than 2,000 insomniacs in one-to-one clinics, workshops and retreat environments. The Sleep School Approach teaches insomniacs that relinquishing the need to control sleep or by trying to avoid uncomfortable sensations that occur in the middle of the night by getting out of bed and 'doing' other things only strengthens insomnia and prolongs its vicious cycle.

    <h2>
    4. This Book Will Send You to Sleep by K. McCoy and Dr. Hardwick
    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraphs">
        This Book Will Send You to Sleep makes no claims to be fun or interesting. It is a book you can read in full confidence that you will find absolutely nothing to stimulate your brain. A book, like any other, that will afford you much sleep and copious amounts of pointless knowledge.
        <br><br>
        Where else will you read about the political crisis in Belgium 2007–2011 or the recent developments in the taxonomy of molluscs? And where else can you find, in one place: a summary of the administrative bureaucracy of the Byzantine Empire? a world almanac of pickled cucumbers? the measurement of the linear density of fibre?

    5. Sleep by Nick Littlehales
    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraphs">

    <br>The power of the nap - and how you can nap with your eyes open.
    <br>Ways to deal with anxiety, children, snoring and other night-time challenges.
    <br>How to discover your own sleep cycle.

    7. Cured: The Power of Our Immune System and the Mind-Body Connection by Dr Jeff Redger
    </h2>
    <h3 class="paragraphs">
        Dr Jeff Rediger, a world-leading Harvard psychiatrist, has spent the last fifteen years studying thousands of individuals from around the world, examining the stories behind extraordinary cases of recovery from terminal illness.<br>
        <br>
        Observing the common denominators of people who have beaten the odds, Dr Rediger reveals the immense power of our immune system and unlocks the secrets of the mind-body connection. In Cured , he explains the vital role that nutrition plays in boosting our immunity and fighting off disease, and he also outlines how stress, trauma and identity affect our physical health.<br>
        <br>
        In analysing the remarkable science of recovery, Dr Rediger reveals the power of our mind to heal our body and shows us the keys to good health.    </h3>

    <h2>
        8. The Neuroscience of Excellent Sleep by Stan Rodski
        </h2>
        <h3 class="paragraphs">
            In this book, renowned neuroscientist Dr Stan Rodski takes us through the fundamentals of sleep - how sleep works, why we sleep and how much sleep we need - but, most importantly, he gives us exercises to help overcome the bane of insomnia. In any endeavour, the key to achievement is proper preparation, and sleep is no different. Drawing on the techniques of mindfulness, meditation and relaxation, and the neuroscience that underpins them all, Dr Stan gives you the tools to prepare yourself (and your children) for an excellent sleep - and enjoy it!        </h3>
