         <p>This information page aims to explain the difficulties of getting enough quality sleep, as sometimes it can be helpful to first identify what is causing the issue in order to learn how to solve it.
            Many students attending DKIT may believe that they can afford to spend less hours sleeping now that they have reached an adult age, but this could not be less true as the human brain continues to develop until the age of 25.
            There are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different.
            On average, a “normal” amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less.
            What's important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality.
            You're probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it's affecting your everyday life.
            Sleep deprivation is a condition characterised by inadequate or insufficient sleep sustained over a period of time. It occurs when an individual consistently fails to obtain the amount of sleep that they need.
            Sleep is a vital physiological process that allows the body and brain to rest, recover and perform essential functions including memory consolidation, emotional regulation, immune function and general health maintenance.
