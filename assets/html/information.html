             <p>This information page aims to explain the difficulties of getting enough quality sleep, as sometimes it can be helpful to first identify what is causing the issue in order to learn how to solve it.
                Many students attending DKIT may believe that they can afford to spend less hours sleeping now that they have reached an adult age, but this could not be less true as the human brain continues to develop until the age of 25.
                There are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different.
                On average, a “normal” amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less.
                What's important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality.
                You're probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it's affecting your everyday life.
                Sleep deprivation is a condition characterised by inadequate or insufficient sleep sustained over a period of time. It occurs when an individual consistently fails to obtain the amount of sleep that they need.
                Sleep is a vital physiological process that allows the body and brain to rest, recover and perform essential functions including memory consolidation, emotional regulation, immune function and general health maintenance.

            1. Sleep apnea
            </h2>
            <h3 class="paragraphs">
            The conventional image of sleep apnea is of the overweight man who snores, but women of any size can also develop these repeated pauses in breathing while they sleep. A man or woman who has a narrow jaw or a change in muscle tone can get apnea. Either of these anatomical issues can block oxygen from reaching your lungs (and subsequently the rest of your body) while you sleep. Snoring might not be your main symptom if you do have sleep apnea, but you will notice that you're especially sleepy during the day.

            <div class="solinfobody">
                <h3 class="paragraphs">
                <u>Solution</u>: Try simple interventions first. Exercise every day, take a hot bath before bed, massage your legs, and cut back on things that can make you jittery—like caffeine and tobacco. If these measures don't work, your doctor may recommend one of several medicines that reduce RLS symptoms—including ropinirole (Requip), pramipexole (Mirapex), rotigotine (Neupro), or gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant).

            2. Diet
            </h2>
            <h3 class="paragraphs">
            What you eat can affect your sleep. Spicy foods can contribute to painful heartburn. Big meals leave you uncomfortably full, and over time can contribute to obesity—a well-known risk factor for sleep apnea. Too much caffeine could keep you wide awake, even if you finish your coffee in the morning. It can take up to six hours to clear half of the caffeine from your body. If you have enough caffeine, it's still in your body at 4 in the morning. And though a glass of wine or two with dinner will make you feel relaxed or even sleepy, it won't help you sleep. You can fall asleep, but once you're asleep you can't sleep deeply.
            </h3>
            <div class="solinfobody">
                <h3 class="paragraphs">
                <u>Solution</u>: Eat dinner at least a couple of hours before bedtime and keep the meal light. Avoid spicy, fatty foods, as well as alcohol and caffeine. Also, don't drink too many fluids before bed. Having to constantly get up to go to the bathroom can disrupt your sleep, too.

            3. Lack of exercise
            </h2>
            <h3 class="paragraphs">
            Sleep and exercise complement each other. Working out regularly can help you sleep better, and conversely, you're more likely to exercise if you get a good night's rest.
            </h3>
            <div class="solinfobody">
                <h3 class="paragraphs">
                <u>Solution</u>: Exercise every day if you can, ideally in the morning. Doing a high-energy aerobic routine too close to bedtime can have the opposite of the intended effect, making you too energized to sleep. A gentle yoga stretch before bed probably won't hurt, though. It might even help you relax.

            4. Pain
            </h2>
            <h3 class="paragraphs">
            Arthritis aches or any other kinds of pain do not make for restful slumber. Conversely, a lack of sleep can increase your pain. Researchers believe that a lack of sleep may activate inflammatory pathways that exacerbate arthritis pain. Poor sleep can also make you more sensitive to the feeling of pain.
            </h3>
            <div class="solinfobody">
                <h3 class="paragraphs">
                <u>Solution</u>: In addition to the pain remedies your doctor recommends, try using a heating pad or taking a warm bath before bed to soothe achy joints or muscles. Lying against a body pillow can put you in a more comfortable position while you sleep.

        6. Depression
        </h2>
        <h3 class="paragraphs">
            Depression is a common compromiser of sleep, and it is more common in women than in men. People who are depressed may sleep more than usual, but their sleep isn't restful. Some of the antidepressants meant to counteract depression, particularly SSRIs, can also interfere with sleep.
        </h3>
        <div class="solinfobody">
            <h3 class="paragraphs">
            <u>Solution</u>: See your primary care doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist for help, which may include medications, talk therapy, or both. If your antidepressant seems to be keeping you awake, ask your doctor to switch you to another drug.

            <h3 class="paragraphs">
                It's impossible to sleep when the weight of the day is pressing on you. Finding a sense of calm before bed isn't easy—especially when you can't unplug from the demands of your day.
            </h3>
            <div class="solinfobody">
                <h3 class="paragraphs">
                <u>Solution</u>: Establish wind-down time. Do a quiet, relaxing activity before bed that doesn't involve a screen. Talk to a friend or family member, sew, or read a real book—not one on a backlit tablet device. Just allow yourself to have quiet time. And don't sleep with your smartphone on your bedside table.

                <h3 class="paragraphs">
                    Sometimes insomnia stems from long-ingrained behaviors, like staying up too late or engaging in stimulating activities before bed.

                <div class="solinfobody">
                    <h3 class="paragraphs">
                    <u>Solution</u>: Follow a few basic sleep hygiene strategies. Go to bed and wake up at the same times each day. Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and comfortable. Use your bed for sleep only. If you can't fall asleep within 15 minutes, get up and leave the bedroom. Read or do another quiet activity for 15 to 20 minutes until you get sleepy.
