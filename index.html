        <b>Sleep is invaluable to young students attending DKIT in order to stay in good health.</b> The importance of it is typically
         overlooked by many who habitually stay up all night to complete their assignments. According to the CDC, Adequate sleep
        contributes to a student's overall health and well-being. Students should get the proper amount of sleep at night to help them
        stay focused, improve concentration, and improve academic performance. The data from the 2015 national and state Youth Risk Behavior
        Surveys, a CDC study, shows that a majority of middle school and high school students reported getting less than the recommended
        amount of sleep for their age. In fact, according to The Sleep Foundation, most college-aged students need 7–9 hours of sleep in
        order to avoid daytime drowsiness (inability to concentrate or remember and slowed reaction time), altered mood states (anxiety,
        irritability, and depression), weight gain, poor health, and low energy.

        <b>Why deprive the powerhouse of the body of rest?</b> Sleep, especially undisturbed sleep, helps the brain process and retain information it has learned.
        And when someone is sleep-deprived, attention span and memory also are impaired. Fifty percent of college
        students report feeling sleepy during the day, while 70% of students are not getting a sufficient number
        of hours of sleep on a regular basis. (While everyone is different, on average, college-aged young adults
        need about eight hours of sleep per night.) Sleep quality, a measure of whether sleep is effective (i.e.,
        restful and restorative), is made up of a combination of factors: how long it takes to fall asleep, number
        of times waking up per night, amount of nighttime wakefulness, and how much time is actually spent asleep
        once in bed. Sleep quality is also poor among college students on average, with one study showing that over
        60% of college students met criteria for being poor-quality sleepers.
