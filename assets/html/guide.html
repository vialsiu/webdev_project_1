            <p>Getting into a good sleep pattern may take weeks. Thankfully, you can do it by making small changes at a time.This information page aims to explain the difficulties of getting enough quality sleep, as sometimes it can be helpful to first identify what is causing the issue in order to learn how to solve it.
                Many students attending DKIT may believe that they can afford to spend less hours sleeping now that they have reached an adult age, but this could not be less true as the human brain continues to develop until the age of 25.
                There are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night.
                On average, a “normal” amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less.
                What's important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality.
                You're probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it's affecting your everyday life.
                Sleep deprivation is a condition characterised by inadequate or insufficient sleep sustained over a period of time. It occurs when an individual consistently fails to obtain the amount of sleep that they need.
                Sleep is a vital physiological process that allows the body and brain to rest, recover and perform essential functions including memory consolidation, emotional regulation, immune function and general health maintenance.

                    To help your body clock get into a rhythm:<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Get up at the same time.<br>
                    2. Go outside and get light exposure during the day.<br>
                    3. Go to bed at the same time.<br>
                    Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep. By working out what time you need to wake up, you can set a regular bedtime schedule.<br>
                    <br>
                    Keep the same routine at weekends too. Sleeping in can disrupt your sleep pattern.
                    <br>
                    Avoid naps during the day. Napping can make it harder to fall asleep at night.

                    Avoid or cut down on things that keep you awake and affect sleep quality.<br>

                    <b class="bguide">Nicotine:</b><br>
                    The nicotine in cigarettes is a stimulant. People who smoke take longer to fall asleep, wake up more often and have more disrupted sleep.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b class="bguide">Alcohol:</b><br>
                    Alcohol may help you to fall asleep, but it harms the quality of your sleep and can wake you up in the night.
                    <br>
                    If you have disrupted sleep, avoid drinking alcohol in the evenings.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b class="bguide">Caffeine:</b><br>
                    Caffeine can make it difficult to fall asleep and it can prevent deep sleep. Drinks with caffeine in them include tea, coffee, energy drinks or soft drinks. Foods can also contain caffeine, such as chocolate and some protein bars. If you have trouble sleeping, avoid caffeine 4 to 6 hours before bed.<br>

                    Winding down is an important stage in preparing for bed. It helps you to relax and gets your body ready for sleep. Create a wind-down routine that works for you.<br>

                    <br>
                    1. Do gentle stretches to relax your muscles, such as gentle yoga.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Listen to relaxing sounds, for example, guided relaxation or calming music.<br>

                    4. Have a warm bath to help your body reach a temperature that's ideal for rest.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Put your phone away - it's easy to spend more time on it than you intended.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Bright light from screens can affect your body clock. Limit your use of electronic devices in the hour before bed.<br>
